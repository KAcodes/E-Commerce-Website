# E-Commerce Site built with React Context API


## Project Description

This project was built using React to practice and showcase my use of building a responsive website in which state of the website is easily accessible across components. It is a fictitious simple shopping site in which the user can view/add/remove items to a shopping cart.

React Context was used to manage state of objects and allow functionality across the site. The website uses fake data obtained from the Faker API which produced fake data in JSON format. This data was used to build "product" objects, which makes up the items seen on the shopping page. React-Bootstrap was used to help style the page consistently.

The user can add/remove products to the shopping cart and filter what items they can see on the home page using the filter sidebar or the search bar in the navigation bar. Navigating to the shopping cart the user can modify their basket there and see what the total of their shopping amounts to.
